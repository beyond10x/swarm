# Epic: <name>

## Outcome

*The change in the world this delivers, for whom, and how anybody would know it had happened.*

## Why Now

*What makes this the right thing to start — a commitment, a constraint, a cost that is growing. An
epic with no answer here is a backlog entry.*

## Scope

*The shape of the work: the surfaces it touches and the capabilities it adds. Not a task list — the
stories underneath carry that, through `decomposes`.*

## Out of Scope

*What is deliberately left out, and where it goes instead. This is the section that gets read in
three months when somebody asks why the thing they wanted is missing.*

## Risks

*What could make this take twice as long or land wrong, and what would show it early.*

## Ambiguities

*Each gap this epic leaves for the stories under it, classified. `inferable` — the answer is
already written down, so give the `path:line` or the artifact id that settles it.
`requires-stakeholder-input` — nobody here can decide it, so name who does, and raise that entry as
a `decision-blocker` with a `blocks` edge to this epic, or it is a sentence somebody improvises
later.*

## Done When

*The condition under which this epic moves to `implemented` — stated once, here, so it is not
renegotiated story by story.*
